Random datasets I've found on the intertubes and processed via the Elastic stack. Some manipulation has been done to clean the data up, see the per directory READMEs for more info.

Masive H/T to [Data Is Plural](http://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) for their amazing weekly newsletter, as many datasets have been discoverd via them. If you are after interesting datasets, it's well worth subscribing.

This assumes you already have Elasticsearch >2.3, Logstash >2.3 and Kibana >4.5 (along with Sense installed), along with Java 8/7.
